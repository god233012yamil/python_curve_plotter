PyQtGraph is a graphics and user interface library for Python that provides functionality commonly required in engineering and science applications. Its primary goals are 
1) provide fast, interactive graphics for displaying data (plots, video, etc.). 
2) provide tools to aid in rapid application development (for example, property trees such as used in Qt Designer).

PyQtGraph makes heavy use of the Qt GUI platform (via PyQt or PySide) for its high-performance graphics and numpy for heavy number crunching. In particular, pyqtgraph uses Qtâ€™s GraphicsView framework which is a highly capable graphics system on its own; we bring optimized and simplified primitives to this framework to allow data visualization with minimal effort.
